        Refactor and cleanup

        # 1.0.5
        * Play signed, extensionless video embeds such as OGInstagram reels using Discord's proxy URL.
        * Keep inline videos playing when message rows refresh.
        * Fall back to Discord's normal click behavior when the inline player cannot be displayed.
        * Keep hosted clicks usable when a preview is unavailable.
        * Load Spotify short links in the embed player after they resolve.
        * Handle YouTube playlists and already embedded SoundCloud widget URLs.

        # 1.0.4
        * Play extensionless video URLs using the media type supplied in the embed, without adding service-specific host rules.

        # 1.0.3
        * Load YouTube's /embed/{id} endpoint directly instead of wrapping it in a synthetic iframe page.
        * Fix Spotify embeds failing to load the playable player.
        * Keep YouTube playback active when adding reactions refreshes the message.
        * Replace the entire YouTube embed card with the player again.
        * Fix touch handling so GIFs and other embeds can be tapped and opened normally.
        * Avoid Kkinstagram-specific handling and leave Discord-native embeds untouched.

        # 1.0.2
        * Keep hosted videos playing when reactions refresh their embed rows.
        * Let Discord handle Kkinstagram embeds without plugin interception.
        * Keep selected YouTube videos inside the inline player after fullscreen.

        # 1.0.1
        * Improve YouTube player loading and error reporting.
        * Play hosted media inside the original image area at its default size, preserving the embed layout.
        * Prevent panel swipes from interrupting the inline YouTube seekbar.
        * Fix search-result clicks playing embeds instead of jumping to the message.

        # 1.0.0
        * Play direct video and audio link embeds in Discord's built-in media player.
